# AlgoDocs

AlgoDocs is a personal documentation project for **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** (DSA), along with curated solutions to **LeetCode** problems. The goal is to make learning and understanding DSA simpler through easy-to-follow explanations, visual diagrams, and step-by-step solutions.

> ⚠️ Please note: This is not an official DSA documentation. All content is based on my personal knowledge, approaches, and solutions.

## Features

- 📚 **Comprehensive DSA Documentation**: In-depth explanations of data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, etc.) and algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.).
- 💡 **Easy-to-Understand Solutions**: LeetCode problems are explained in a way that’s beginner-friendly, with simple language and clear steps.
- 🖼️ **Diagrams and Visuals**: Visual aids like diagrams and flowcharts are included to make complex concepts easier to grasp.
- 🔄 **Interactive Examples**: Solutions are not just explained but also broken down into examples with detailed steps.
- 🎨 **Visual Enhancements**: Emojis and formatting are used to make the documentation visually appealing and engaging.
- 📈 **Optimized for Learning**: Each section focuses on building a solid foundation with concise explanations, followed by progressively more advanced concepts.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js (for static site generation and dynamic content rendering)
- **Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript
- **UI/UX**: TailwindCSS, Styled Components
- **Graphics**: Diagrams made with tools like Figma and Excalidraw for clear and concise visual representations.

## How to Use

1. Browse the docs to explore different data structures and algorithms.
2. Dive into detailed LeetCode solutions with step-by-step breakdowns.
3. Use the diagrams to visually understand how each algorithm or data structure works.
4. Enhance your learning experience by following along with examples.
