## Insertion of a Node in a Linked List Data Structure

In the last tutorial, we had learned about creating a linked list using C structures and traversing through them while printing the values at each node. Today, we’ll learn how to insert a node at some position and how that is more efficient than inserting an element in an array.

Inserting in an array has already been covered, and the following remarks were made:

1. A void has to be made to insert an element.
2. Creating a void causes the rest of the elements to shift to their adjacent right.
3. Time complexity: O(no. of elements shifted)

**Inserting in a linked list:**
Consider the following Linked List,

<AdaptiveThemeImage
  src={{
    dark: "/images/17.svg",
    light: "/images/17.svg",
  }}
  className="mx-auto pb-4 pt-0"
  width={570}
  height={400}
  alt="example"
/>

Insertion in this list can be divided into the following categories:

**Case 1:** Insert at the beginning

**Case 2:** Insert in between

**Case 3:** Insert at the end

**Case 4:** Insert after the node

For insertion following any of the above-mentioned cases, we would first need to create that extra node. And then, we overwrite the current connection and make new connections. And that is how we insert a new node at our desired place.

**Syntax for creating a node:**

```C
struct Node *ptr = (struct Node*) malloc (sizeof (struct Node))
```
The above syntax will create a node, and the next thing one would need to do is set the data for this node.

```
ptr -> data = 9 
```
This will set the data.

Now, let's begin with each of these cases of insertion.

### Case 1: Insert at the beginning

In order to insert the new node at the beginning, we would need to have the head pointer pointing to this new node and the new node’s pointer to the current head.

<AdaptiveThemeImage
  src={{
    dark: "/images/18.svg",
    light: "/images/18.svg",
  }}
  className="mx-auto pb-4 pt-0"
  width={570}
  height={400}
  alt="example"
/>

### Case 2: Insert in between:

Assuming index starts from 0, we can insert an element at index i>0 as follows:

1. Bring a temporary pointer p pointing to the node before the element you want to insert in the linked list.
2. Since we want to insert between 8 and 2, we bring pointer p to 8.

<AdaptiveThemeImage
  src={{
    dark: "/images/19.svg",
    light: "/images/19.svg",
  }}
  className="mx-auto pb-4 pt-0"
  width={570}
  height={400}
  alt="example"
/>

### Case 3: Insert at the end:

In order to insert an element at the end of the linked list, we bring a temporary pointer to the last element.
