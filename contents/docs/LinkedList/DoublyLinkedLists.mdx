## Doubly Linked Lists Explained

We have already discussed various types of linked lists. We covered singly linked lists, where the head node is followed by the last node pointing to `NULL`. We also talked about circular linked lists, which have no end but do have a designated head node. In both types, we explored basic operations like traversal, insertion, deletion, and searching.

### Takeaway:
The main takeaway is that we can perform all these operations on any variant of a linked list, regardless of its structure or properties. Today, we'll look at another type of linked list and see how it relates to what we’ve learned so far.

### What is a Doubly Linked List?
In a **doubly linked list**, each node contains a data part and two pointers: one pointing to the **previous node** and the other to the **next node**.

Below is a visual representation of a doubly linked list with three nodes, where both the end pointers point to `NULL`.

### How is it Different from a Singly Linked List?

- A **doubly linked list** allows traversal in **both directions**. Each node contains the address of both the next node and the previous node, giving us the flexibility to move either right or left.
- A node consists of three parts: the data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node.
- The **head node** has its pointer to the previous node set to `NULL`.

### Memory Considerations:
The extra pointer to the previous node allows for bidirectional traversal, but it also requires more memory for each node. This is a trade-off compared to a singly linked list, which only stores the data and the next node's address.

### Implementation in C:

Let’s consider implementing a doubly linked list. The structure (`struct Node`) is similar to what we’ve seen before, with the addition of a pointer to the previous node. This new pointer, often named **prev**, enables travel in both directions but comes with an added memory cost for each node, now having three parts.

```C
struct Node {
    int data;
    Struct Node* next;
    Struct Node* prev;
};
```

### Operations on a Doubly Linked List:

Insertion and deletion in a doubly linked list are performed by adjusting pointer connections, just like in a singly linked list.

The key difference here is that we need to adjust **two pointers** (prev and next) instead of just one (next) like we did with singly linked lists. It reflects the saying, "With great power, comes great responsibility." :)

#### Task:
Try implementing a traversal algorithm that:
- Traverses once to the right (using the next pointer).
- Traverses once to the left (using the prev pointer).

Print the data in both cases.

That’s all for linked lists! It has been a great segment, and we hope you’ve found it helpful. Keep an eye out for upcoming topics, and remember to revisit and revise things regularly.


> Code as described/written in the all docs:

```C
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

struct Node
{
    int data;
    struct Node *next;
};

void linkedListTraversal(struct Node *head){
    struct Node *ptr = head;
    do{
        printf("Element is %d\n", ptr->data);
        ptr = ptr->next;
    }while(ptr!=head);
}

struct Node * insertAtFirst(struct Node *head, int data){
    struct Node * ptr = (struct Node *) malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    ptr->data = data;

    struct Node * p = head->next;
    while(p->next != head){
        p = p->next;
    }
    // At this point p points to the last node of this circular linked list

    p->next = ptr;
    ptr->next = head;
    head = ptr;
    return head;

}

int main(){
    
    struct Node *head;
    struct Node *second;
    struct Node *third;
    struct Node *fourth;

    // Allocate memory for nodes in the linked list in Heap
    head = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    second = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    third = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    fourth = (struct Node *)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));

    // Link first and second nodes
    head->data = 4;
    head->next = second;

    // Link second and third nodes
    second->data = 3;
    second->next = third;

    // Link third and fourth nodes
    third->data = 6;
    third->next = fourth;

    // Terminate the list at the third node
    fourth->data = 1;
    fourth->next = head;

    printf("Circular Linked list before insertion\n");
    linkedListTraversal(head);
    head = insertAtFirst(head, 54);
    head = insertAtFirst(head, 58);
    head = insertAtFirst(head, 59);
    printf("Circular Linked list after insertion\n");
    linkedListTraversal(head);
    return 0;
}
```
