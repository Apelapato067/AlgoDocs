## Introduction to Linked List in Data Structures

The study of linked lists will certainly be detailed, but first, I would like to highlight a fundamental difference between linked lists and arrays.

Arrays require contiguous memory allocation, which means their size cannot be easily changed. To increase an array's size, you must copy the entire array to a larger memory location. Additionally, inserting or deleting an element requires shifting elements right or left, respectively.

In contrast, linked lists are stored in non-contiguous memory locations. To add a new element, you simply create a node in memory and link it to the previous element. Deleting an element is similarly straightforward; you just adjust the pointers to skip the node you want to remove. Consequently, extending a linked list is quite efficient.

### Structure of a Linked List

Each element in a linked list is referred to as a node, which consists of two parts: the data part and the pointer part. The data part holds the value, while the pointer part contains the address of the next node in the list.

Both arrays and linked lists are classified as linear data structures.

Linked Lists VS Arrays:

  height={400}

### Why Linked Lists?

Memory and the capacity of an array remain fixed, while linked lists allow us to add and remove elements without any capacity constraints.

**Drawbacks of Linked Lists:**

- Extra memory space is required for pointers (each node needs additional space for a pointer).
- Random access is not allowed, as elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations.

### Implementations

Linked lists are implemented in C language using a structure. You can refer to the snippet below.

**Understanding the snippet below:**
1. We construct a structure named `Node`. 
2. Define two of its members: an integer `data` that holds the node's data, and a structure pointer `next` that points to the address of the next structure node.

```c
struct Node
{
    int data;
    struct Node *next; // Self referencing structure
};
```

These were just the basics of the linked lists. We haven’t delved into details. There’s a lot to cover in this data structure.
