title: Selection Sort Program
description: Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the first unsorted element.

## Selection Sort Program in C

Let's review the characteristics of the selection sort algorithm before moving on to the programming part:

1. The time complexity of the selection sort algorithm is `O(n^2)` in all cases.
2. It is not a stable algorithm because it does not preserve the original order of equal elements, as we saw in an earlier example.
3. Selection sort is not a recursive algorithm.
4. It is not an adaptive algorithm, as it makes comparisons regardless of whether the array is already sorted or not.

That being all that was known about the selection sort algorithm, let us move on to the programming part. I have attached the source code below. Follow it as we proceed.

### Understanding the code snippet below:

1. Start by defining an array of numbers that we want to sort.

2. Define a variable to store how many numbers are in the array.

3. Before writing the Selection Sort function, create a function to display the numbers in the array.

4. If you already have a function to display the array from earlier lessons, just use that.

```C
void printArray(int* A, int n){
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        printf("%d ", A[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```

5. Create a function called `selectionSort` that does not return a value (void) and takes the array and its length as inputs. 

   Inside this function, create two integer variables: one for the minimum index called `indexOfMin` and another for swapping called `Now`. 

   Use a loop to keep track of the number of passes. For an array of length `n`, you will need to make `(n-1)` passes, starting from the 0th index and ending at the (n-1)th index.

   At each pass, set `indexOfMin` to the first index of the unsorted part of the array, which is represented by `i`.

Create another loop to go through the rest of the unsorted elements and check for any element smaller than the one at `indexOfMin`. 

   This loop should start from `i + 1` and go to the end of the array. 

   During each iteration, compare the current element at index `j` with the element at `indexOfMin`. If the element at index `j` is smaller, update `indexOfMin` to `j`.

After finishing the second loop, swap the elements at indices `i` and `indexOfMin` using a temporary variable. Repeat these steps for each pass until the array is sorted.

And at the end, when you finish iterating through both the `i` and the `j` loops, you would receive a sorted array. All we had to do was this.

```C
void selectionSort(int *A, int n){
    int indexOfMin, temp;
    printf("Running Selection sort...\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++)
    {
        indexOfMin = i;
        for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++)
        {
            if(A[j] < A[indexOfMin]){
                indexOfMin = j;
            }
        }
        // Swap A[i] and A[indexOfMin]
        temp = A[i];
        A[i] = A[indexOfMin];
        A[indexOfMin] = temp;
    }
}
```

> Code Snippet 2: Creating the selectionSort function

**Here is the whole source code:**

```C
#include<stdio.h>

void printArray(int* A, int n){
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        printf("%d ", A[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}

void selectionSort(int *A, int n){
    int indexOfMin, temp;
    printf("Running Selection sort...\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++)
    {
        indexOfMin = i;
        for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++)
        {
            if(A[j] < A[indexOfMin]){
                indexOfMin = j;
            }
        }
        // Swap A[i] and A[indexOfMin]
        temp = A[i];
        A[i] = A[indexOfMin];
        A[indexOfMin] = temp;
    }
}

int main(){
    // Input Array (There will be total n-1 passes. 5-1 = 4 in this case!)
    //  00  01  02  03  04
    // |03, 05, 02, 13, 12

    // After first pass
    //  00  01  02  03  04
    //  02,|05, 03, 13, 12

    // After second pass
    // 00  01  02  03  04
    // 02, 03,|05, 13, 12

    // After third pass
    // 00  01  02  03  04
    // 02, 03, 05,|13, 12

    // After fourth pass
    // 00  01  02  03  04
    // 02, 03, 05, 12,|13


    int A[] = {3, 5, 2, 13, 12};
    int n = 5;
    printArray(A, n);
    selectionSort(A, n);
    printArray(A, n);

    return 0;
}
```

> Code Snippet 3: Program to implement the Selection Sort Algorithm

Let us now check if our functions work well. Consider an array A of length 5.

```C
    int A[] = {3, 5, 2, 13, 12};
    int n = 5;
    printArray(A, n);
    selectionSort(A, n);
    printArray(A, n);
```

And the output we received was:

```
3 5 2 13 12 
Running Selection sort...
2 3 5 12 13
