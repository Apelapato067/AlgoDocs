description: A Queue can be implemented using arrays, linked lists, or built-in data structures, where elements are added to the rear (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue).

## Queue Implementation: Array Implementation of Queue in Data Structure

In the last docs, we introduced to you a new data structure, queue. Today, we’ll learn how to implement queues ADT using arrays. During our discussion, we compared its representation to our own lives. It is analogous to a queue in front of any ticket counter or an ice cream shop illustrated below.

<AdaptiveThemeImage
  src={{
    dark: "/images/3.webp",
    light: "/images/3.webp",
  }}
  className="mx-auto pb-4 pt-0"
  width={770}
  height={450}
  alt="example"
/>

Here, we have shown a branded ice cream shop that is famous enough to have a queue of people waiting to get one of their choices. And the shop owner wants to store the information of these people, so he uses an array to accomplish that. Assuming that we have 8 people and we want to store their information, we’ll have an array as illustrated below:

<AdaptiveThemeImage
  src={{
    dark: "/images/67.svg",
    light: "/images/67.svg",
  }}
  className="mx-auto pb-4 pt-0"
  width={770}
  height={450}
  alt="example"
/>

Here, we’ll maintain an index variable, backInd, to store the index of the rearmost element. So, when we insert an element, we just increment the value of the backInd and insert the element at the current backInd value. Follow the array below to know how inserting works:

<AdaptiveThemeImage
  src={{
    dark: "/images/68.svg",
    light: "/images/68.svg",
  }}
  className="mx-auto pb-4 pt-0"
  width={770}
  height={450}
  alt="example"
/>

Now suppose we want to remove an element from the queue. And since a queue follows the FIFO discipline, we can only remove the element at the zeroth index, as that is the element inserted first in the queue. So, now we will remove the element at the zeroth index and shift all the elements to its adjacent left. Follow the illustrations below:

<AdaptiveThemeImage
  src={{
    dark: "/images/69.svg",
    light: "/images/69.svg",
  }}
  className="mx-auto pb-4 pt-0"
  width={770}
  height={450}
  alt="example"
/>

But this removal of the zeroth element and shifting of other elements to their immediate left features O(n) time complexity. 

Summing up this method of enqueue and dequeue, we can say:

1. Insertion( enqueue ):
    - Increment backInd by 1.
    - Insert the element
    - Time complexity: O(1)

2. Deletion( dequeue ):
    - Remove the element at the zeroth index
    - Shift all other elements to their immediate left.
    - Decrement backInd by 1

3. Here, our first element is at index 0, and the rearmost element is at index backInd.

4. Condition for queue empty: backInd = -1.

5. Condition for queue full: backInd = size-1.

Can there be a better way to accomplish these tasks? The answer is yes.

We can use another index variable called frontInd, which stores the index of the cell just before the first element. We’ll maintain both these indices to bring about all our operations. Let’s now enlist the changes we’ll see after we introduce this new variable:

1. Insertion( enqueue ):

    - Increment backInd by 1.
    - Insert the element
    - Time complexity: O(1)

2. Deletion( dequeue ):

    - Remove the element at the zeroth index( no need for that in an array )
    - Increment frontInd by 1.
    - Time complexity: O(1)

3. Our first element is at index frontInd +1, and the rearmost element is at index backInd.

4. Condition for queue empty: frontInd = backInd.

5. Condition for queue full: backInd = size-1.

Now, we were able to achieve both operations in constant run time. And the new dequeue operation goes as follow:

<AdaptiveThemeImage
  src={{
    dark: "/images/70.svg",
    light: "/images/70.svg",
  }}
  className="mx-auto pb-4 pt-0"
  width={770}
  height={450}
  alt="example"
/>

The act of optimizing a solution/program is very important, and you should always strive for a better solution to a problem. And a solution that takes less time is always preferred. So, this is how we implement the queue ADT using an array. The programming part is still left, which will be covered in the next tutorial. But before you proceed, make sure you are finished with all the fundamentals.
