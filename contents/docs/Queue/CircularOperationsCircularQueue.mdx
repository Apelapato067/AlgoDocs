title: Circular Queue & Operations on Circular Queue
description: A Circular Queue is a linear data structure where the last position connects back to the first, forming a circle, which allows efficient reuse of space. Its operations include Enqueue (inserting elements), Dequeue (removing elements), and handling circular overflow by wrapping around the rear and front pointers.

## C Code For Circular Queue & Operations on Circular Queue 

We have completed our exploration of the implementation of circular queues using arrays, along with the algorithms for enqueuing and dequeuing elements. We also examined the conditions for determining when a circular queue is full or empty. If you missed the previous documentation, I recommend reviewing it first, as we discussed key concepts essential for understanding this topic. Today, we will focus solely on the programming aspect.

*Note*: In circular queues, the *f* (front) is always an index behind the first element, which means there is always a vacant index in circular queues.

Let's get your editors involved. Below is the source code you should keep handy while understanding the implementation.

### Understanding the code snippet below:

1. **Copy the Queue Implementation**: Begin by copying everything from the existing queue implementation program, as the concepts are similar. Circular queues are simply a variation of normal queues, so we will make subtle modifications to adapt the code.

2. **Modify the Structure**: Since we are working with a circular queue, change the struct named `queue` to `circularQueue`. The four members should remain the same as in the queue structure:
   - An integer variable `size` to store the size of the array.
   - An integer variable `f` to store the index of the front end.
   - An integer variable `r` to store the index of the rear end.
   - An integer pointer `arr` to store the address of the dynamically allocated array.

```C
struct circularQueue
{
    int size;
    int f;
    int r;
    int* arr;
};
```

**Code Snippet 1: Declaring struct circularQueue**

#### 3. In main, we had declared a struct circularQueue q, and initialized its instances. Here is a subtle change, we don’t initialize circular queues’ f and r with -1, rather 0. Since -1 is unreachable in circular incrementation. Leave everything as it is.

```C
    struct circularQueue q;
    q.size = 4;
    q.f = q.r = 0;
    q.arr = (int*) malloc(q.size*sizeof(int));
```

**Code Snippet 2: Defining and initialising a struct element q**

#### 4. Modifying isEmpty:

If you remember, the condition for isEmpty remains the same for both queues and circular queues. So, no modifications are needed here. Leave this as well.

```C
int isEmpty(struct circularQueue *q){
    if(q->r==q->f){
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Code Snippet 3: Modifying the isEmpty function**

#### 5. Modifying isFull:

Earlier, isFull checked if our rear has reached the limit of the array. And if it did, we returned the overflow statement. But now, the queue isn’t full until technically. So, just see if the index next to the rear becomes front or not. Use circular increment (modulus) to pursue any increment in a circular queue. 

So, check if (r element of q) +1 is equal to the (f element of q). If it is, then there is no space left in the queue to insert anymore elements, hence return 1, else 0.

```C
int isFull(struct circularQueue *q){
    if((q->r+1)%q->size == q->f){
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

```C
int isFull(struct circularQueue *q){
    if((q->r+1)%q->size == q->f){
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Code Snippet 4:  Modifying the isFull function**

#### 6. Modifying Enqueue:

In the function enqueue, first of all, check if the queue is full by calling the isFull function. If it returns 1, then print the condition of the queue overflow and return. Else, increase the r value of q circularly using the arrow operator and modulus, and insert the new value at the increased index r of the array arr.

```C
void enqueue(struct circularQueue *q, int val){
    if(isFull(q)){
        printf("This Queue is full");
    }
    else{
        q->r = (q->r +1)%q->size;
        q->arr[q->r] = val; 
        printf("Enqued element: %d\n", val);
    }
}
```

**Code Snippet 5:  Modifying the enqueue function**

#### 7. Modifying Dequeue:

Earlier when we dequeued in a queue, we would simply increase the value of f by 1. We would now increase but circularly, and that would be it.

In the function dequeue, first, check whether the circular queue is already not empty by calling isEmpty. If it returns 1, then print the condition of the queue underflow and return. Else, increase the f value of q using the arrow operator circularly, and store the value at the index f of the array in some integer variable a. Later, return a.

```C
int dequeue(struct circularQueue *q){
    int a = -1;
    if(isEmpty(q)){
        printf("This Queue is empty");
    }
    else{
        q->f = (q->f +1)%q->size;
        a = q->arr[q->f]; 
    }
    return a;
}
```

**Code Snippet 6:  Modifying the dequeue function**

> Here is the whole source code:

```C
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
 
struct circularQueue
{
    int size;
    int f;
    int r;
    int* arr;
};
 
 
int isEmpty(struct circularQueue *q){
    if(q->r==q->f){
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
 
int isFull(struct circularQueue *q){
    if((q->r+1)%q->size == q->f){
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
 
void enqueue(struct circularQueue *q, int val){
    if(isFull(q)){
        printf("This Queue is full");
    }
    else{
        q->r = (q->r +1)%q->size;
        q->arr[q->r] = val; 
        printf("Enqued element: %d\n", val);
    }
}
 
int dequeue(struct circularQueue *q){
    int a = -1;
    if(isEmpty(q)){
        printf("This Queue is empty");
    }
    else{
        q->f = (q->f +1)%q->size;
        a = q->arr[q->f]; 
    }
    return a;
}
 
 
int main(){
    struct circularQueue q;
    q.size = 4;
    q.f = q.r = 0;
    q.arr = (int*) malloc(q.size*sizeof(int));
    
    // Enqueue few elements
    enqueue(&q, 12);
    enqueue(&q, 15);
    enqueue(&q, 1); 
    printf("Dequeuing element %d\n", dequeue(&q));
    printf("Dequeuing element %d\n", dequeue(&q));
    printf("Dequeuing element %d\n", dequeue(&q)); 
    enqueue(&q, 45);
    enqueue(&q, 45);
    enqueue(&q, 45);
 
    if(isEmpty(&q)){
        printf("Queue is empty\n");
    }
    if(isFull(&q)){
        printf("Queue is full\n");
    }
 
    return 0;
}
```

**Code Snippet 7: Implementing a circular queue and its operations using arrays**

Now you can actually see what happened here. Earlier when we enqueued elements to the full and dequeued everything again as seen in the illustration below, the queue still remained full.

<AdaptiveThemeImage
  src={{
    dark: "/images/82.svg",
    light: "/images/82.svg",
  }}
  className="mx-auto pb-4 pt-0"
  width={770}
  height={450}
  alt="example"
/>

You can even use the queue implementation code to see that.  But now when you enqueue elements to its full and delete everything, the circular queue becomes empty, unlike the normal queue. You can very easily now insert at (3+1)%4 index which is the zeroth index. I’ll show you that using the code.

<AdaptiveThemeImage
  src={{
    dark: "/images/83.svg",
    light: "/images/83.svg",
  }}
  className="mx-auto pb-4 pt-0"
  width={770}
  height={450}
  alt="example"
/>

Let us now insert/enqueue three elements inside the queue. And see if it reverts the full message.

```C
    enqueue(&q, 12);
    enqueue(&q, 15);
    enqueue(&q, 1);
    if(isFull(&q)){
        printf("Queue is full\n");
    }
```

**Code Snippet 8: Using the enqueue function**

Our terminal had the following output:

```
Enqued element: 12
Enqued element: 15
Enqued element: 1
Queue is full
PS D:\Code>
```

**Figure 1: Output of the above program**

Now let’s dequeue everything and see if the queue again becomes empty or not.

```C
    printf("Dequeuing element %d\n", dequeue(&q));
    printf("Dequeuing element %d\n", dequeue(&q)); 
    printf("Dequeuing element %d\n", dequeue(&q)); 
    if(isEmpty(&q)){
        printf("Queue is empty\n");
    }
```

> Code Snippet 9: Using the dequeue function

And the output we received was:

```
Dequeuing element 12
Dequeuing element 15
Dequeuing element 1
Queue is empty
PS D:\Code>
```
