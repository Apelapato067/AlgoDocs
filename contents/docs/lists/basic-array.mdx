Arrays support several basic operations, including **insertion** and **deletion**. Understanding these operations is essential for working efficiently with arrays.

#### 1. Insertion

**Insertion** is the process of adding a new element to the array. There are three common scenarios for insertion:
1. **At the Beginning**: Insert an element at the start of the array.
2. **At a Specific Index**: Insert an element at a specific position in the array.
3. **At the End**: Insert an element at the end of the array.

Since arrays are of fixed size, when inserting into a full array, a new larger array is typically created to accommodate the new element.

##### **Insertion at the Beginning:**
Inserting at the beginning requires shifting all existing elements one position to the right to make room for the new element.

```java
// Inserting at the beginning of an array
int[] numbers = {2, 3, 4, 5};
int elementToInsert = 1;
int[] newArray = new int[numbers.length + 1];

// Shift existing elements
for (int i = numbers.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
  newArray[i + 1] = numbers[i];
}
// Insert the new element
newArray[0] = elementToInsert;

// Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

##### **Insertion at a Specific Index:**

Inserting at a specific index requires shifting all elements starting from that index to the right by one position.

```java
// Inserting at index 2
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 4, 5};
int elementToInsert = 3;
int index = 2;
int[] newArray = new int[numbers.length + 1];

// Copy elements up to the index
for (int i = 0; i < index; i++) {
  newArray[i] = numbers[i];
}
// Insert the new element
newArray[index] = elementToInsert;
// Shift remaining elements
for (int i = index; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  newArray[i + 1] = numbers[i];
}

// Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

##### **Insertion at the End:**

Inserting at the end is the easiest operation, as no shifting is required.

```java 
// Inserting at the end
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4};
int elementToInsert = 5;
int[] newArray = new int[numbers.length + 1];

// Copy all elements
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  newArray[i] = numbers[i];
}
// Insert the new element
newArray[numbers.length] = elementToInsert;

// Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

#### 2. Deletion

**Deletion** is the process of removing an element from the array. Similar to insertion, there are three common deletion scenarios:

1. At the Beginning: Remove the first element.
2. At a Specific Index: Remove an element at a specific position.
3. At the End: Remove the last element.

After removing an element, we need to shift the remaining elements to fill the gap.

**Deletion at the Beginning:**

Deleting the first element requires shifting all other elements one position to the left.

```java
// Deleting from the beginning
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int[] newArray = new int[numbers.length - 1];

// Shift elements to the left
for (int i = 1; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  newArray[i - 1] = numbers[i];
}

// Output: [2, 3, 4, 5]
```

**Deletion at a Specific Index:**

Deleting at a specific index requires shifting all elements after the deleted element to the left.

```java
// Deleting at index 2
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int index = 2;
int[] newArray = new int[numbers.length - 1];

// Copy elements before the index
for (int i = 0; i < index; i++) {
  newArray[i] = numbers[i];
}
// Shift remaining elements
for (int i = index + 1; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  newArray[i - 1] = numbers[i];
}

// Output: [1, 2, 4, 5]
```

**Deletion at the End:**

Deleting the last element does not require any shifting.

```java
// Deleting the last element
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int[] newArray = new int[numbers.length - 1];

// Copy all elements except the last one
for (int i = 0; i < newArray.length; i++) {
  newArray[i] = numbers[i];
}

// Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

##### Summary:
- Insertion may involve shifting elements to make space for the new element, depending on the location.
- Deletion often involves shifting elements to fill the gap left by the removed element

*Arrays are useful due to their random access capabilities, but insertion and deletion operations can be costly (O(n) time complexity) if they require shifting multiple elements.*
