# How to Calculate Time Complexity of an Algorithm + Solved Questions 

Techniques to calculate Time Complexity:

Once we can express the runtime in relation to the size of the input (\(n\)), we can determine the time complexity. For example:

```java
 T(n) = n2 → O(n^2)
T(n) = logn → O(logn)
```

**Here are some tricks to calculate complexities:**

- **Drop the constants:** Any time complexity expressed as O(kn) (where \(k\) is a constant) can be simplified to O(n). This is a more effective representation since the \(k\) term has little impact on complexity as \(n\) increases.

- **Drop the non-dominant terms:** A time complexity expressed as O(n² + n) can be simplified to O(n²), as non-dominant terms become negligible for larger values of \(n\).

- **Consider all input variables:** Time complexities such as O(mn) and O(mnq) can arise in certain scenarios, where \(m\), \(n\), and \(q\) are all variables provided as input.

In most cases, we try to represent the runtime in terms of the inputs which can even be more than one in number. For example,

The time taken to paint a park of dimension m * n → O (kmn) → O (mn) 

**Time Complexity – Competitive Practice Sheet:**

### Question1: Fine the time complexity of the func1 function in the program shown in the snippet below:

```c
#include<stdio.h>

void func1(int array[], int length)
{
    int sum=0;
    int product =1;
    for (int i = 0; i <length; i++)
    {
        sum+=array[i];
    }
 
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
    {
        product*=array[i];
    }
}
 
int main()
{
    int arr[] = {3,4,66};
    func1(arr,3);
    return 0;
}

```

### Question 2: Find the time complexity of the func function in the program from program2.c as follows:

```c
void func(int n)
{
    int sum=0;
    int product =1;
    for (int i = 0; i <n; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
        {
            printf("%d , %d\n", i,j);
        }
    }
}

```

### Question 3: Consider the recursive algorithm below, where the random(int n) spends one unit of time to return a random integer where the probability of each integer coming as random is evenly distributed within the range [0,n]. If the average processing time is T(n), what is the value of T(6)?

```c
int function(int n)
{
    int i = 0;
    if (n <= 0)
    {
        return 0;
    }
    else
    {
        i = random(n - 1);
        printf("this\n");
        return function(i) + function(n - 1 - i);
    }
}
```

### Question 4: Which of the following are equivalent to O(N) and why?

1. O(N + P), where P < N/9
2. 0(9N-k)
3. O(N + 8log N)
4. O(N + M2)

### Question 5: The following simple code sums the values of all the nodes in a balanced binary search tree ( don’t worry about what it is, we’ll learn them later ). What is its runtime?

```c
int sum(Node node)
{
    if (node == NULL)
    {
        return 0;
    }
    return sum(node.left) + node.value + sum(node.right);
}
```

### Question 6: Find the complexity of the following code which tests whether a given number is prime or not?

```c
int isPrime(int n)
{
    if (n == 1)
    {
        return 0;
    }
    for (int i = 2; i * i < n; i++)
    {
        if (n % i == 0)
        {
            return 0;
        }
    }
    return 1;
}
```

### Question 7: What is the time complexity of the following snippet of code?

```c
int isPrime(int n)
{
    for (int i = 2; i * i < 10000; i++)
    {
        if (n % i == 0)
        {
            return 0;
        }
    }
 
    return 1;
}
isPrime();
```
