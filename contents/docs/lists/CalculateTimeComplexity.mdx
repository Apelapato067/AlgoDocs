# How to Calculate Time Complexity of an Algorithm + Solved Questions (With Notes)

In previous videos, we had discussed what time complexity is and how it helps in dealing with what is most efficient for our programs. Our task today will be to find out how to calculate the time complexity of our programs. Here are some tips and tricks about the same, followed by a discussion of some questions.

Techniques to calculate Time Complexity:

Once we are able to write the runtime in terms of the size of the input (n), we can find the time complexity. For example:

```java
 T(n) = n2 → O(n^2)
T(n) = logn → O(logn)
```

**Here are some tricks to calculate complexities:**

- Drop the constants:
Anything you might think is O(kn) (where k is a constant) is O(n) as well. This is considered a better representation of the time complexity since the k term would not affect the complexity much for a higher value of n.
- Drop the non-dominant terms: : 
Anything you represent as O(n2+n) can be written as O(n2). Similar to when non-dominant terms are ignored for a higher value of n.
- Consider all variables which are provided as input:
O (mn) and O (mnq) might exist for some cases.

In most cases, we try to represent the runtime in terms of the inputs which can even be more than one in number. For example,

The time taken to paint a park of dimension m * n → O (kmn) → O (mn) 

**Time Complexity – Competitive Practice Sheet:**

### Question1: Fine the time complexity of the func1 function in the program shown in the snippet below:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void func1(int[] array) {
        int sum = 0;
        int product = 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
            sum += array[i];
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
            product *= array[i];
        }

        // Optionally print the results
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
        System.out.println("Product: " + product);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {3, 4, 66};
        func1(arr);
    }
}
```

### Question 2: Find the time complexity of the func function in the program from program2.c as follows:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void func(int n) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                System.out.println(i + ", " + j);
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 3; // You can change this value to test with different sizes
        func(n);
    }
}
```

### Question 3: Consider the recursive algorithm below, where the random(int n) spends one unit of time to return a random integer where the probability of each integer coming as random is evenly distributed within the range [0,n]. If the average processing time is T(n), what is the value of T(6)?

```java
import java.util.Random;

public class Main {
    private static final Random random = new Random();

    public static int function(int n) {
        if (n <= 0) {
            return 0;
        } else {
            int i = random.nextInt(n); // Generates a random integer between 0 (inclusive) and n (exclusive)
            System.out.println("this");
            return function(i) + function(n - 1 - i);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 5; // You can change this value to test with different inputs
        int result = function(n);
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);
    }
}
```

### Question 4: Which of the following are equivalent to O(N) and why?

1. O(N + P), where P < N/9
2. 0(9N-k)
3. O(N + 8log N)
4. O(N + M2)

### Question 5: The following simple code sums the values of all the nodes in a balanced binary search tree ( don’t worry about what it is, we’ll learn them later ). What is its runtime?

```java
class Node {
    int value;
    Node left;
    Node right;

    Node(int value) {
        this.value = value;
        this.left = null;
        this.right = null;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static int sum(Node node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        return sum(node.left) + node.value + sum(node.right);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage:
        Node root = new Node(10);
        root.left = new Node(5);
        root.right = new Node(15);
        root.left.left = new Node(3);
        root.left.right = new Node(7);
        
        int totalSum = sum(root);
        System.out.println("Total sum: " + totalSum);
    }
}
```

### Question 6: Find the complexity of the following code which tests whether a given number is prime or not?

```java
public class Main {
    public static int isPrime(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) {
            return 0; // 0 and 1 are not prime numbers
        }
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) { // Use <= to include the square root
            if (n % i == 0) {
                return 0; // n is not prime
            }
        }
        return 1; // n is prime
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 29; // You can change this value to test with different numbers
        int result = isPrime(number);
        System.out.println("Is " + number + " prime? " + (result == 1 ? "Yes" : "No"));
    }
}
```

### Question 7: What is the time complexity of the following snippet of code?

```java
public class Main {
    public static int isPrime(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) {
            return 0; // 0 and 1 are not prime numbers
        }
        
        // Check for divisibility from 2 up to 10,000 (or until the square root of n)
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= n && i < 10000; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                return 0; // n is not prime
            }
        }
        return 1; // n is prime
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 29; // You can change this value to test with different numbers
        int result = isPrime(number);
        System.out.println("Is " + number + " prime? " + (result == 1 ? "Yes" : "No"));
    }
}
```

So, these were the few questions I felt like discussing. Try them on your own first. And if you have already given them enough thought, then move on to the video above where we have discussed their solutions in detail. Hopefully, they were able to make you learn how to find the time complexities for different programs.
