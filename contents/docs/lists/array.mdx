An array is a linear data structure that stores a collection of elements (usually of the same type) in a contiguous block of memory. Each element in the array can be accessed using an index, where the index represents the position of the element in the array.

- **Indexing:** Arrays typically use zero-based indexing, meaning the first element is at index `0`, the second at index `1`, and so on.
- **Fixed Size:** The size of an array is typically fixed when it is created, meaning the number of elements an array can hold is determined at the time of initialization.
- **Homogeneous Elements:** Arrays store elements of the same data type. For instance, an array of integers stores only integers.

#### Key Characteristics:
1. **Contiguous Memory Allocation:** All elements are stored in adjacent memory locations.
2. **Random Access:** You can directly access any element using its index in constant time, i.e., O(1) time complexity.
3. **Efficient for Traversal:** Traversing or iterating through the array elements is straightforward.

#### Example:
A simple array of integers:

```java
    int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

In the above array:

- The element at index 0 is 1.
- The element at index 3 is 4.

Arrays are commonly used due to their simplicity and efficiency in situations where the number of elements is known beforehand and does not change frequently.
