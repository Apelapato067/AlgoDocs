# Operations on Arrays in Data Structures: Traversal, Insertion, Deletion and Searching

**Operations on an Array:**
While there are many operations that can be implemented and studied, we only need to be familiar with the primary ones at this point.  An array supports the following operations:

- Traversal
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Search

Other operations include sorting ascending, sorting descending, etc. Let's follow up on these individually.

### Traversal:
Visiting every element of an array once is known as traversing the array.

**Why Traversal?**
For use cases like:

- Storing all elements – Using Scanner
- Printing all elements – Using System.out.println()

Updating elements. An array can easily be traversed using a for loop in Java.

**An important note on Arrays:**
If we create an array of length 100 using int[] a = new int[100]; in Java, we do not need to use all the elements. It is possible for a program to use just 60 elements out of these 100. (But we cannot go beyond 100 elements).
