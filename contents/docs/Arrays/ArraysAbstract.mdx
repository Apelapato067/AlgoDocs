# Arrays and Abstract Data Type in Data Structure

## Abstract Data Types and Arrays:

Abstract Data Types (ADTs) classify data structures by defining a minimal expected interface along with a set of methods. This concept is similar to creating a blueprint before starting a project, whether it’s building a computer or constructing a building.

Array - ADT
An array ADT holds the collection of given elements (can be int, float, custom) accessible by their index.

1. **Minimal Required Functionality:**  
   An array has two basic functionalities:  
   - **get(i):** Retrieves the element at index \(i\).  
   - **set(i, num):** Assigns the value \(num\) to the element at index \(i\).  

2. **Operations:**  
   We can perform various operations on the array, but we'll focus on some basic ones:  
   - **Max():** Returns the maximum element in the array.  
   - **Min():** Returns the minimum element in the array.  
   - **Search(num):** Searches for the element \(num\) in the array.  
   - **Insert(i, num):** Inserts the value \(num\) at index \(i\).  
   - **Append(x):** Adds the value \(x\) to the end of the array.  

**Static and Dynamic Arrays:**  
- **Static Arrays:** The size cannot be changed after creation.  
- **Dynamic Arrays:** The size can be adjusted as needed.

**Quick Quiz**- Code the operations mentioned above in C language by creating array ADT.
**Hint**: Use structures.

Memory Representations of Array:
<AdaptiveThemeImage
  src={{
    dark: "/images/6.svg",
    light: "/images/6.svg",
  }}
  className="mx-auto pb-4 pt-0"
  width={570}
  height={400}
  alt="example"
/>

- Elements in an array are stored in contiguous memory locations.

- Elements can be accessed using the base address in constant time, O(1).

- While the size of an array cannot be changed directly, it can be reallocated to a larger memory location. However, resizing an array is a costly operation.

Suppose we want to build an array as an abstract data type with our customized set of values and customized set of operations in a heap. Let’s name this customized array myArray. 

Let our set of values which will represent our customized array include these parameters:

- total_size
- used_size
- base_address

And the operations include operators namely,

- max()
- get(i)
- set(i,num)
- add(another_array)

So, now when we are done creating a blueprint of the customized array. We can very easily code their implementation, but before that, let’s first learn what these values and operations, we have defined, do:

## Understanding the ADT Above:

- **total_size:** This variable stores the total reserved size of the array in memory.

- **used_size:** This variable keeps track of the amount of memory currently being used.

- **base_address:** This is a pointer that stores the address of the first element of the array.

Let the illustration below serve as an example of the concepts discussed.

<AdaptiveThemeImage
  src={{
    dark: "/images/7.svg",
    light: "/images/7.svg",
  }}
  className="mx-auto pb-4 pt-0"
  width={570}
  height={400}
  alt="example"
/>

Here, the total_size returns 6, and the used_size returns 3.
