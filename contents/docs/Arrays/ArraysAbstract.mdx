# Arrays and Abstract Data Type in Data Structure

## Abstract Data Types and Arrays:

ADTs or abstract data types are the ways of classifying data structures by providing a minimal expected interface and some set of methods. It is very similar to when we make a blueprint before actually getting into doing some job, be it constructing a computer or a building. The blueprint comprises all the minimum required logistics and the roadmap to pursuing the job.

<AdaptiveThemeImage
  src={{
    dark: "/images/5.svg",
    light: "/images/5.svg",
  }}
  className="mx-auto pb-4 pt-0"
  width={570}
  height={400}
  alt="example"

Array - ADT
An array ADT holds the collection of given elements (can be int, float, custom) accessible by their index.

1. Minimal required functionality:
We have two basic functionalities of an array, a get function to retrieve the element at index i and a set function to assign an element to some index in the array.
    - get (i) – get element i
    - set (i, num) – set element i to num.

2. Operations:-
We can have a whole lot of different operations on the array we created, but we’ll limit ourselves to some basic ones.
    - Max()
    - Min()
    - Search ( num )
    - Insert ( i, num )
    - Append (x)

Static and Dynamic Arrays:
- Static arrays – Size cannot be changed
- Dynamic arrays – Size can be changed

**Quick Quiz**- Code the operations mentioned above in C language by creating array ADT.
**Hint**: Use structures.

Memory Representations of Array:
<AdaptiveThemeImage
  src={{
    dark: "/images/6.svg",
    light: "/images/6.svg",
  }}
  className="mx-auto pb-4 pt-0"
  width={570}
  height={400}
  alt="example"
/>

- Elements in an array are stored in contiguous memory locations.
- Elements in an array can be accessed using the base address in constant time → O (1).
- Although changing the size of an array is not possible, one can always reallocate it to some bigger memory location. Therefore resizing in an array is a costly operation.

Suppose we want to build an array as an abstract data type with our customized set of values and customized set of operations in a heap. Let’s name this customized array myArray. 

Let our set of values which will represent our customized array include these parameters:

- total_size
- used_size
- base_address

And the operations include operators namely,

- max()
- get(i)
- set(i,num)
- add(another_array)

So, now when we are done creating a blueprint of the customized array. We can very easily code their implementation, but before that, let’s first learn what these values and operations, we have defined, do:

## Understanding the ADT above:
- total_size: This stores the total reserved size of the array in the memory location.
- used_size: This stores the size of the memory location used.
- base_address: This is a pointer that stores the address of the first element of the array.

Let the below-illustrated array be an example of what we are talking about.

<AdaptiveThemeImage
  src={{
    dark: "/images/7.svg",
    light: "/images/7.svg",
  }}
  className="mx-auto pb-4 pt-0"
  width={570}
  height={400}
  alt="example"
/>

Here, the total_size returns 6, and the used_size returns 3.

We will keep the code implementation of the above ADT for the next docs. You can even give it a try on your editors. Use structs and define that set of values with proper data types.
